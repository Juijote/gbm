New in 1.03

- (Windows) You can no longer Alt-Tab to GBM while it's minimized to the system tray.  This was an unintentional change in v1.02 and caused various bugs.
- (Windows) Fixed various issues and inconsistent behavior when using the system tray and menu.
- (Linux) Free drive space is now checked correctly when performing a backup.  GBM now requires "df" (Coreutils) on Linux.
- (All) Error messages related to SQLite will now be displayed correctly, instead of forcing the application to exit.

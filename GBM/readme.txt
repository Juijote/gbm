Disclaimer:

v1.2.9 is still in development, this file will be updated as changes are made.
The development branch is currently backwards compatible with v1.2.8.

New in 1.2.9

All Platforms:

- The "Game Path" field in the Game Manager no longer automatically trims a file name when included.
	- Unfortunately this feature caused too many other issues and simply does not work in all situations.
- The GBM tray icon and tooltip is now more informative when the backup path is not available on startup.
- The Custom Filter window in the Game Manager can now be closed by using the X button.

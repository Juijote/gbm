New in 1.2.3

All Platforms:

- Improvements to the "Choose Game" window	
	- It should now always be displayed in front of other windows after closing a game.
	- It now appears in the taskbar, just in case it does get hidden behind other windows.
	- The GBM icon is now displayed on this window.
- Improvements to the "Import Game Configurations" window
	- Added "Show Selected Only" option.  
		- This option will filter the current list to show only what's currently selected.
		- This option can be combined with the text filter.
	- You can now maximize or minimize this window.
	- The GBM icon is now displayed on this window and it now appears in the taskbar.

Windows:

- Simplified the code used to hide the main window.  
	- Prevents the weird flicker effect that could occur when clicking the close button.

v1.2.3 is still in development.  This file will be updated as changes are made.

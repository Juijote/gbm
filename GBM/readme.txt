New in 1.2.6

All Platforms:

- If GBM quits unexpectedly during a backup operation, such as a power outage or OS shutdown, any incompleted backup operations will be resumed automatically the next time you run the app.
- Fixed the "Limit" field always displaying zero on the Game Manager.
- The "Play" button on the main form is now disabled for a few seconds after clicking.
	- This prevents attempting to launch a game multiple times by accident.
- The "Last Action" field on the main form now uses the regional setting for "Short Time" instead of being set to a specific format.

New in 1.3.1

Disclaimer:

v1.3.1 is still in development, this file will be updated as changes are made.
Database changes made in development builds may not be compatible with the final release.  Use at your own risk!

All Platforms:

- Fixed an issue with the import feature not syncing immediately after being used from the main window or system tray.
	- This would cause imported changes to be lost if GBM was closed before a sync was triggered by another action.
- Improved the pending backup notification feature.	
	- Clicking notification now opens the Game Manager to the "Backup Management" tab with the first game selected.
	- The notification will no longer keep reappearing during a session when all pending backups are not restored.

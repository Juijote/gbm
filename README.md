Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them.  Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression.  GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any Windows game or application.
